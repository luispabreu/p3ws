Previously, we worked through the first 4 steps for the "closest point" problem---given
a set S and a point P, find the member of S which is closest to P. Now you
are ready to turn this into code.

You already have a Point class from a previous assignment, which you will use for
this assignment.  As you have done before, you will want to symlink point.py
from assignment 12:

  ln -s ../12_point/point.py  ./

You will also need to import the Point class, as you did in the "circle" assignment.

In a file called cp.py, you should write the function:

closestPoint(s,p)

where
  s is a set of Points
and
  p is a Point
such that this function returns the element of s closest to p.

You should also write test cases for your function to convince yourself
that it is correct.
