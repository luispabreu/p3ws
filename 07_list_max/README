 1. Open the provided listmax.py file and write
    the function:
      listMax(list);
    which returns the largest element in the list passed in.
    If the list has no elements or is None, this function
    should return None.*

 2. Run and test your code. 
    We have provided a main function, which will print test cases and
    your function's answer for them. You should get 
    99, -3, 425, None, and None for the five tests provided.

 3. Submit your code.  

* Note: the Python library function max() behaves differently for an
  empty list or None, but we have not covered exceptions yet, so
  listMax will have slightly different behavior for these corner
  cases.
