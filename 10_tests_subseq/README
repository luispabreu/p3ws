For this assignment, you will be writing test cases for your next
assignment. The instructions for that assignment can be found in
next-README, which you should use to figure out how to test the
program you will be writing, but you should NOT write the program
until you have passed this testing assignment. 

As with the match5 assignment, one correct and several broken
implementations can be found in 
  /usr/local/p3ws/subseq.

These are provided as bytecode, .pyc files, and you should write a
program (in test-subseq.py) whose main function tests the maxSeq
function. To do this, assume you will have a file "subseq.pyc" (which
the run_all.sh script will create for you), and import maxSeq:
  from subseq import maxSeq
Also, indicate a failure case by exiting failure. To do this, import
sys, and use the line
  sys.exit(1)
to indicate failure and exit.

Think about a handy way to abstract the testing into a function.

The script run_all.sh will test your test-subseq.py with all of the
implementations.
