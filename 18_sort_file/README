For this assignment, you should make a file called sortfile.py,
and  write the function

sortFile(filename)

which takes the name of a file, reads all of the lines in that file,
and sorts them.  This function should return a list containing the lines
of the file in sorted order.
For example, if the passed in file contained

xyz
abc
def
qqq

This function would return the list
['abc', 'def', 'qqq', 'xyz']
